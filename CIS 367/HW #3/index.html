      <h3>Scene Background Information</h3>
      <p>
        This WebGL 2D render is of a few video game assets from the new Nintendo Switch game, <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i>.
        Unfortunately my WebGL skills are not yet up to par, but this is a nice framework for a scene that introduces the
        new character, the <i>Piranha Plant</i> from the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> series. The red sphere is the logo for
        the game, and the other object is of the character, Piranha Plant.

      <h3>Scene Marked Sketch</h3>
      <p>
        The marked sketch may seem a little hard to understand, but it's divided into 3 parts. <b class="blue">Blue</b> markings
        represent quad polygons using <b class="blue">TRIANGLES_STRIP</b>. <b class="yellow">Gold</b> markings represent circles, ellpises, or cones (parts of circles)
        that can be drawn using <b class="yellow">TRIANGLES_FAN</b>. And finally, <b class="pink">Pink</b> markings represent actual triangles
        that can be drawn using <b class="pink">TRIANGLES</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          NOTE: Not shown are two outlines. The first outline is all along the logo circle object on the right, this will be done using <b>LINE_STRIP</b>.
          Secondly, there will be an outline along the bottom of the character for clarification using <b>LINES</b>.

        The most <b>intriguing/challenging</b> aspect of this rendering is the mouth opening/cone shape in the Piranha plant.
        Since circles are within the polar plane and we are in the cartesian coordinate system, it's a little hard to take a chunk
        of a circle. However, with a little experimentation and math it wasn't that difficult, but the started code provided
        lots of versatility. For example, the brown shadow at the bottom was created as an ellipse that takes a xMax and yMax
        parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>depth</b> effect was used a little bit differently in this scene. The depth effect was used to create
        layering, such as for the teeth to overlay on top of the mouth cone opening, which layers on top of the piranha
        plant head.
